# Repository Guidelines

## Project Structure & Module Organization
This is a Vite + React + TypeScript app that uses TanStack Router.

- `src/main.tsx` bootstraps the app and router.
- `src/routes/` defines route files and route loaders.
- `src/components/` holds reusable UI components.
- `src/lib/` contains shared logic, utilities, and state (see `src/lib/store.test.ts`).
- `src/styles.css` is the global stylesheet.
- `public/` stores static assets; `dist/` is the build output.

## Build, Test, and Development Commands
Use `bun` or `npm` to run scripts from `package.json`.

- `bun run dev` (or `npm run dev`): start the Vite dev server on port 3000.
- `bun run build`: create a production build in `dist/`.
- `bun run serve`: preview the production build locally.
- `bun run test`: run Vitest in CI mode.
- `bun run lint`: run ESLint (TanStack config).
- `bun run format`: check formatting with Prettier.
- `bun run check`: auto-format and auto-fix lint issues.

## Coding Style & Naming Conventions
- Language: TypeScript + React (ES modules).
- Formatting: Prettier with `semi: false`, `singleQuote: true`, `trailingComma: all`.
- Linting: ESLint via `@tanstack/eslint-config`.
- Naming: React components in `PascalCase`, hooks in `useCamelCase`, files in `kebab-case` or `camelCase` following existing patterns.

## Testing Guidelines
- Framework: Vitest + Testing Library (`@testing-library/react`) with `jsdom`.
- Naming: `*.test.ts` (example: `src/lib/store.test.ts`).
- No explicit coverage threshold; keep tests focused on behavior and state transitions.

## Commit & Pull Request Guidelines
- Commits follow Conventional Commits: `feat:`, `fix:`, `refactor:`, `chore:`, `build:`.
- Keep messages short and scoped to a single change.
- PRs should include: a brief description, testing notes (command + result), and screenshots/gifs for UI changes.
- Link issues when applicable.

## Configuration & Tips
- The dev server runs on port 3000; update if you need a different port.
- Avoid editing `dist/` directly; it is generated by `bun run build`.
